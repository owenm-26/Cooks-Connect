## CooksConnect 
### Summary 
A mobile app that allows users to input what ingredients they have on hand, and tells them what dishes they can make sourced from a database. Users can choose a recipe and then add it to their list of “dishes completed” visible on their profile. Cooks Connect also considers a user's diet by providing additional low-calorie and vegan recipes to users.
(Optional) Based on tags related to the cuisine or cooking time of each dish, users can earn badges that are also displayed on their profile and compete against their friends.
