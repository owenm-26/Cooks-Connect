## Idea #1: CooksConnect 
### Summary 
A mobile app that allows users to input what ingredients they have on hand that tells them what dishes they can make. Users can choose a recipe and then add it to their list of “dishes completed” visible on their profile. 
(Optional) Based on tags related to the cuisine or cook time of each dish, users can earn badges that are also displayed on their profile and compete against their friends.
